# docker-node-mongo-app-deployment

### Prerequisites
- Make sure docker is installed in your laptop/pc 
- NPM is installed 

### creating app in your local machine 
1) create a directory in your home folder ```mkdir ~/my-node-mongo-app && cd ~/my-node-mongo-app```
2) Let initialize npm by doing ```npm init .``` and keep on hitting enter until you see entry point
3) let type ```server.js``` on entry point because this will be the first file to execute when we run
4) Keep on hitting return key until done
5) if you do ```ls -la``` you will see package.json file. This is where we will specify our dependency
